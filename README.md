# extkube

Usage:
```bash
extkube --config ${K8S_CONTEXT}
```

This command will print: 
```
Copied:
export KUBECONFIG="/var/folders/yz/7drt587x27g8cltqm8f1qfn80000gn/T/kubeconfig-2314541764"
to clipboard
```

and then you can paste that line into any terminal window, which will change KUBECONFIG only for this particular terminal window.
